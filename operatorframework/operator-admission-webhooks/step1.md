Let's begin by creating a new project called `myproject`:

```
oc new-project myproject
```{{execute}}
<br>
Let's now copy the memcached operator to our working directory:

```
\cp -r /tmp/memcached-operator $HOME/projects
```{{execute}}
<br>
Navigate to the directory:

```
cd $HOME/projects/memcached-operator
```{{execute}}
<br>
